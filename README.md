# advent of code 2021

advent of code 2021 in z80 assembly for ti83+ family calculators

uses some DoorsCS routines for now, might convert to my own later.

code in `source/`. use `./compile.sh DAYXX` or `./compile.bat DAYXX` to compile a day. copy from `exec/` to calculator and run for results. compilation needs mono installed on linux.
